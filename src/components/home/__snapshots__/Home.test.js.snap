  Welcome! I'm Cari, a Full Stack JavaScript developer, musician, and graphic designer.

    </p>
    <p>
      
  After a decade performing and teaching music, I started dabbling in freelance website design and digital marketing for small businesses.
  I made my way up to the Pacific Northwest and joined the tech scene as a support agent, later working as a QA tester for a small software company.
  While testing all weekly releases and pairing with UI/UX to propose new system features, I fell in love with the software development cycle and decided to take the plunge into coding.

    </p>
    <p>
      
  In early 2019, I completed a 6 month intensive training program in full stack JavaScript, focusing in front-end website design as well as DevOps, managing the release flow.
  I made this site with React and styled it with PostCSS. I'm a self taught multi-instrumentalist and audio engineer, fierce problem solver and collaborative team player, and I love learning new technologies.
