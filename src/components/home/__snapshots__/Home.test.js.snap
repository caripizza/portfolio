      I went to school for visual art, and performed and taught music for a decade after. I did everything from designing and screen printing my own band merchandise, to writing the songs and recording, to teaching music to kids. I'm comfortable creating, coming up with new ideas, and collaborating with a team.

      I began my career in tech 
      8
       years ago, working in technical support and later QA testing. In 2019, I completed a 6 month advanced JavaScript training bootcamp focused mainly on the MERN stack. Since then, I've worked in a variety of codebases and have learned most of all how much I'm driven to work with Product, Design, and Development teams to not only articulate design decisions and document product behavior, but also maintain and ship reusable software built to propel iteration.
